# soccer-sensor-data-analysis

The data source page is here: http://www.orgs.ttu.edu/debs2013/index.php?goto=cfchallengedetails

Please put the full game sensor data file (very large) ```full-game``` as well as output files into this directory during development.

But don't commit/push/upload these huge bulk files onto the github repo!
